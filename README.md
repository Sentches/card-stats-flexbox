## Overview

Hello everyone, this was my first responsive web page that I've built and I'm really happy with what I have learned through this project. It took me about a week to finish 
because I had to rewrite my html code, the first one was filled with <div> and it wasn't very practical. Thanks to some tips that I received about semantics things got a lot easier
for me.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I have learned how to do a responsive page, and it was easier than I expected, at least on this project. How to use meaningful semantic elements, a simpler way to create overlay with just mix blend mode, and the most important thing that I have learned was how flex display works, using flex direction, flex flow and order.

### Continued development

For now, I want to continue to develop my skills, specifically adding JavaScript on my projects and learn about frameworks.
